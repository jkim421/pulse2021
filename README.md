# Pulse Analytics Frontend Take Home Assignment

Welcome to the Pulse Analytics Frontend Take Home Assignment 👋

For this take home assignment, we have three distinct exercises that represent real-world problems we encounter here at Pulse Analytics. We would like you to spend no more than three hours working on this assignment. If you find yourself nearing the three hour mark and are still working, please feel free to spend the rest of your time documenting how you would have gone about completing the exercises.

## Getting Set Up

We recommend using the latest [Node LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`

## Constraints

- Only use JavaScript for this assignment
- Do not install additional packages
- Refrain from touching the directory structure or any existing files unless otherwise stated

## Exercises

Each exercise has a corresponding directory in `src/exercises` with a dedicated README. Refer to the README for that exercise for more detailed instructions. It is imperative that you follow the order of the exercises as they are listed as the exercises will build off of one another.

The seed data that will be used by all of the exercises features "influencers" in the healthcare space. Each entry in the dataset has the following structure:

```
{
  "member": "Person 1",
  "influencerType": "Type D",
  "indicationCategory": "Multiple Myeloma",
  "affiliation": "Cornell",
  "affiliationPosition": "Director of Surgical Oncology",
  "primaryState": "WI",
  "priority": "Medium"
}
```

### 01. `uniqueBy`

For this exercise, we will write a function that ensures the uniqueness of an array of data objects for a given key. For more instructions, refer to the `uniqueBy` [README](https://github.com/pulse-analytics/pulse-analytics-coding-exercise/tree/main/src/exercises/exercise_1_uniqueBy)

### 02. `filterBy`

For this exercise, we will write a function that filters an array of data objects by a given search term. For more instructions, refer to the `filterBy` [README](https://github.com/pulse-analytics/pulse-analytics-coding-exercise/tree/main/src/exercises/exercise_2_filterBy)

### 03. Influencers Display

For this exercise, we will be using React to render our influencers data. The page is going to consist of three parts -- a search bar, a sort button, and a display for our influencers. We've already implemented the search bar so you'll be working on the sort button and the display. For more instructions, refer to the influencers [README](https://github.com/pulse-analytics/pulse-analytics-coding-exercise/tree/main/src/exercises/exercise_3_influencers).

## Submission

Once you're done with your assignment, please upload it to your Github as a public repository and email us the link. Good luck!

## Preferred browser - Google Chrome

  <br/>
  Game Night is a 2D game built to provide a creative playground for users to play, relax and unwind.

---

## 🎮 Prompt🎮

Give the player a challenge: get as high a score as possible without dying!
The idea is this: When you collect all the stars the first time it will release a bouncing bomb. The bomb will just randomly bounce around the level and if you collide with it, you die. All of the stars will respawn so you can collect them again, and if you do, it will release another bomb.

## 🎮 How to contribute to this Project?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcherry000/game-night.git
npm install
npm start
```

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).
